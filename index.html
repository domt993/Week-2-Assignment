                <p>
                    [Verse 1]
                    I see a red door and I want it painted black
                    No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
                    I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
                    I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Verse 2]
                    I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
                    With flowers and my love, both never to come back
                    I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
                    Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Verse 3]
                    I look inside myself and see my heart is black
                    I see my red door, I must have it painted black
                    Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
                    It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Verse 4]
                    No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
                    I could not foresee this thing happening to you
                    If I look hard enough into the setting sun
                    My love will laugh with me before the morning comes
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Verse 1]
                    I see a red door and I want it painted black
                    No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
                    I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
                    I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
                </p>
                <p>
                    [Outro]
                    I wanna see it painted, painted black
                    Black as night, black as coal
                    I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
                    I wanna see it painted, painted, painted
                    Painted black, yeah
                </p>
